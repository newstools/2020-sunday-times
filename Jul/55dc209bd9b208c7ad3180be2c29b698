Mine death toll Â was 51 in 2019, down from 81 the previous year and the lowest since records began a century ago, the Minerals Council, which represents miners, said on Friday. "In 2019, the mining industry recorded the lowest number of fatalities since record-keeping began more than a century ago," the council's chief executive, Roger Baxter, said. A poor safety record in South African mines, which have some of the deepest in the world, has been a concern for investors.
