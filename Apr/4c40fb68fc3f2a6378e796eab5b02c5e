This is an unprecedented moment in SA's history. Lockdown is in full effect, businesses have been temporarily closed, and we're all adjusting to this new normal for as long as it may take. But what does life in lockdown look like? Well, that's up to you. Show us how you're getting through, and what lockdown means to you, by submitting video clips, images, voice notes, or anything else that captures the essence of this extraordinary event. Each weekday, we will choose our favourite submissions to be featured as a daily snapshot of lockdown life and share them to our social channels using the hashtags #UnitedApartSA and #LoveChange. One fantastic submission per day will receive a prize worth R700. Then, when all this is over, our favourite submission will receive a prize valued at R5,000, and we will use all the content we have collected to create a documentary, so the world can see our story.
